# ngl.link-spammer
Spammer for the popular website ngl.link.
Normally, ngl.link throttles a user after 25 messages, but with threads, we can simply send lets say, 250 messages at the same time so it wouldnt throttle us.
To enable proxies, set "proxies" to true in "config.json".
If you enable proxies, each message has a random proxy assigned to it.
If you want to enable random messages, set "randommsgs" to true in "config.json".
If you want to add random messages, do so in msg.py.
To run the code, you must have python and pip installed on your system.
If you do have those installed, run "pip install -r requirements.txt".
When pip finishes, run "python main.py" and fill out the form and you are done!.
